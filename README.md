Spitcast has issues with using HTTPS and requires HTTP. You'll find that when you click on a marker through the gitpages URL you won't get any information. We used spitcast for it's simplicity to show functionallity. Unfortunately spitcast only covers the US west coast. The idea is to eventually cover all surf spots across the world. Because of that, we'll be switching to a different forecasting api.

If you want to test the app out feel free to clone the repo and run it through your local browser. When you click on one of the markers you'll get swell information for 3 parts of the day.
